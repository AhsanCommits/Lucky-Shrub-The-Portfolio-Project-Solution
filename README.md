## Overview

Lucky Shrub is a medium-sized garden design firm that specializes in garden design and creation, maintenance and landscaping. The company also runs a small plant nursery that sells indoor and outdoor plants, making them a one-stop shop for clients to "transform any space into an oasis you can be proud of".

Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason and Maria, who share a long-time love for plants. Jason is the garden architect. He creates and oversees all designs while managing his team of landscapers. Maria manages all the marketing for the company and oversees the nursery.

### The challenge

- You have to develop a home page with a header, main content and footer.
- You will have to decide whether you are going to use a grid or flexbox layout for your home page.
- Your header should contain the client logo and the main content should be a large promotional banner with three columns with text and images below it.
- Your footer will have two columns: the first column should have a small logo and the second one should have copywriting information.
- When it comes to styling, you'll have to create the appropriate look and feel for your client's target audience.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights in the following areas:

- Semantic HTML5 Markup: I prioritized using semantic HTML5 tags to enhance accessibility and maintain a well-structured code. This included utilizing tags like `header`,`<main>`, `<section>`,`article`, and `<footer>` appropriately.

- Flexbox: By employing CSS Flexbox properties like display: flex, justify-content, and align-items, I achieved a responsive and centered design for the component.

- Mobile-first Workflow: I followed a mobile-first approach, designing and developing the component for mobile devices initially and then enhancing it for larger screens.

Additionally, I addressed specific user requirements by ensuring the component's layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. I also implemented a hover state animation on desktop for the navbar links, enhancing user engagement and interaction.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on the following areas:

- Responsive Design: Enhancing my understanding of media queries and advanced techniques for seamless experiences across devices.
- CSS Animation: Exploring CSS animation techniques to create engaging and visually appealing interactions.
- JavaScript Interactivity: Improving my JavaScript skills to add dynamic and interactive elements to components.
- Performance Optimization: Further optimizing code and assets for faster load times.
- Accessibility: Deepening my knowledge of accessibility standards to create inclusive experiences.

### Useful resources

- I found the article titled [A Complete Guide to Flexbox by Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to be immensely beneficial. It provided a comprehensive guide on CSS Flexbox and equipped me with the knowledge necessary to successfully implement it in this project.
